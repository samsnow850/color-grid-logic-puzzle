## About the Game

**Color Grid Logic** is a modern, browser-based puzzle game inspired by Sudoku — but with a twist.  
Instead of numbers, you solve colorful logic grids using shapes and colors. Each puzzle requires you to fill a grid where:

- Each row, column, and sub-grid must contain **each color or shape exactly once**
- Puzzles range in difficulty and size: 4×4, 6×6, or 9×9
- Hints are provided, but solving the puzzle is up to your logic skills!

The game supports **multiple input methods**, features a responsive and accessible design, and includes:

- Multiple difficulty levels  
- Mouse and keyboard input  
- Custom puzzle generation logic  
- Leaderboard with user profiles  
- Light/dark mode toggle  
- Fully functional account system

## How to Play

1. Select a difficulty from the main menu.  
2. Click on any grid cell to highlight it.  
3. Input a color or shape using either:  
   - Your keyboard (keys 1–N)  
   - The on-screen palette  
4. Make sure each row, column, and box has no repeating values.  
5. Solve the entire puzzle to win — or reset to try again!

💡 Tip: Use logic, not guessing — it’s all solvable with reasoning!
